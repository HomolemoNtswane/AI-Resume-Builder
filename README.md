app.py: This is the main Flask application file.

It initializes a Flask app and a Cohere client (with an API key i5CF3sStWeTPbBnaBm15r3d7XgSI5VzIhk7ZOjTF).

The / route handles both GET and POST requests.

On GET, it renders form.html.

On POST, it takes user input (name, job title, experience, education, skills, projects), constructs a prompt for the Cohere API to generate a professional resume, and then renders result.html with the generated resume.

It stores the generated resume and name in the Flask session.

The /download route handles POST requests to download the resume as a PDF.

It retrieves the resume and name from the session.

It uses xhtml2pdf to convert an HTML template (chosen by the user) into a PDF.

templates/form.html: This HTML file likely provides the user interface for inputting resume details. It includes fields for name, email, education, experience, skills, projects, and a dropdown to choose a CV template (Classic, Modern, Elegant).

templates/result.html: This HTML file is used to display the generated resume text to the user and provides a button to download it as a PDF.

templates/pdf_classic.html: This HTML file defines the structure and basic styling for the "Classic" PDF resume template. It appears to be designed for a simpler, less structured resume format with a purple background.

templates/pdf_modern.html: This HTML file defines the structure and basic styling for the "Modern" PDF resume template. It uses a more detailed structure with sections for "Professional Summary", "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills", and "Projects", and a purple color for headings.

templates/pdf_elegant.html: This HTML file defines the structure and basic styling for the "Elegant" PDF resume template. It also has sections like "Profile", "Skills", "Work Experience", and "Education", with a focus on Georgia font and a purple accent color.

static/styles.css: This CSS file contains the styling for the form.html and result.html pages, including background, form container styling, and input field styles.

In summary, this is a web application that leverages the Cohere AI to generate resumes based on user-provided information and allows users to download the generated resume in different PDF templates.
